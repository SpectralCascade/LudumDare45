# LudumDare45
Development repo for my Ludum Dare 45 attempt, to be built upon Ossium. Twitch stream here: https://www.twitch.tv/spectralcascade

## PRE-REQUISITES for building from scratch:
This game will be built using the [Ossium](https://ossiumengine.net) game engine, all dependencies such as SDL 2 are listed on the Ossium website.
If you want to build from source, you need to understand C++ linking. It might help to take a look at the codeblocks project file inside this repo too.
